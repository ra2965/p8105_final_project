#### Raw Data Explanation

  - **NYC Yellow Taxi Data:** The NYC yellow taxi raw data is from the
    [TLC TriP Record
    Data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page).
    It contains all the yellow taxi trip records in NYC from 2009 to
    2019. First, to analyze change of the NYC yellow taxi use across 10
    years, we focus on Yellow Taxi Trip Records raw data in every
    January of 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019. Next, to analyze
    change of the NYC yellow taxi use in detail, we focus on the yeat of
    2018 and generate randomly sampled sub-datasets for each month in
    2018.

Because the raw data is too large, we put it in a folder named
*raw\_data* and added it to the `.gitignore` file. So the *raw\_data*
folder was not uploaded to the Github. The monthly sub-datasets were
generated by randomly sampling 100,000 observations in each month of
2018 and saved in the folder *data*.

  - **NYC Weather Data:** The weather of NYC in 2018 raw data is from
    the [Global Historical Climatology Network’s daily data
    (GHCND)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/global-historical-climatology-network-ghcn).

This dataset can be downloaded by `rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors`.
