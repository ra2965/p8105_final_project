#### Raw Data Explanation

  - **NYC Weather Data:** The weather of New York City (NYC) in 2018 raw
    data is from the [Global Historical Climatology Networkâ€™s daily data
    (GHCND)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/global-historical-climatology-network-ghcn).
    This dataset can be downloaded by `rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors`.

  - **NYC Yellow Taxi Data:** The NYC yellow taxi raw data is from the
    [TLC TriP Record
    Data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page).
    It contains all the yellow taxi trip records in NYC from 2009 to
    2019. First, to analyze change of the NYC yellow taxi use across 10
    years, we focus on Yellow Taxi Trip Records raw data in every
    January of 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019. Next, to analyze
    change of the NYC yellow taxi use in detail, we focus on the yeat of
    2018 and generate randomly sampled sub-datasets for each month in
    2018. Because the raw data is too large, we put it in a folder named
    *raw\_data* and added it to the `.gitignore` file. So the
    *raw\_data* folder was not uploaded to the Github. The monthly
    sub-datasets were generated by randomly sampling 100,000
    observations from each month of 2018 and saved in the folder *data*.

#### Datasets Generation and Cleaning

The code chunk below generates the **NYC weather data** `weather_df`
containing daily temperature and precipitation in NYC 2018 and saves the
dataset as **weather\_nyc\_2018.csv** in the folder **data**.

``` r
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2018-01-01",
    date_max = "2018-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())
```

``` r
write.csv(weather_df, "./data/weather_nyc_2018.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

The code chunk below generates the \*12 NYC yellow taxi datasets** with
100,000 observations randomly sampled from the yellow taxi records in
each month of 2018, and saves the datasets **yellow\_trip\_data\_2018\_
+ month** in the folder **data\*\*.

``` r
set.seed(1)

yellow_trip_data_2018_01 = 
  read_csv(file = "./raw_data/yellow_tripdata_2018-01.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  sample_n(100000) %>% 
  arrange(tpep_pickup_datetime)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   VendorID = col_double(),
    ##   tpep_pickup_datetime = col_datetime(format = ""),
    ##   tpep_dropoff_datetime = col_datetime(format = ""),
    ##   passenger_count = col_double(),
    ##   trip_distance = col_double(),
    ##   RatecodeID = col_double(),
    ##   store_and_fwd_flag = col_character(),

    ##   DOLocationID = col_double(),

    ##   extra = col_double(),
    ##   mta_tax = col_double(),
    ##   tip_amount = col_double(),
    ##   tolls_amount = col_double(),
    ##   improvement_surcharge = col_double(),
    ##   total_amount = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
write.csv(yellow_trip_data_2018_01, "./data/yellow_trip_data_2018_01.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
